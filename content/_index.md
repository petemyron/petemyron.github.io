# PETE MYRON

Hi! I'm an extremely versatile and a quick learner with nearly 20 years of experience creating patented telemetry and monitoring systems, integrating services, and efficiently creating value on anything I touch. I will go deep on any subject of interest, whether it's technical or not, just to learn something new. Curiosity is a daily adventure for me. I'm equally comfortable speaking nerd or business and can thread the needle between the two to help solve problems. I'm happy to manage the workloads of staff or commit code myself.
