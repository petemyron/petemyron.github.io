Hey there! I'm a super versatile techy with almost 20 years of experience creating cool telemetry and monitoring systems, integrating services, and making things better in general. I love diving deep into any topic, whether it's technical or not, just to learn something new. I'm always curious and love exploring new things. I can speak both nerd and business, so I'm great at bridging the gap between the two to help solve problems. Whether it's managing staff or writing code myself, I'm happy to take on any workload.
